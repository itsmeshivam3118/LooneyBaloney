I’ve made a vibrant and engaging single-page website entirely using these fundamental technologies, showcasing the power and creativity that can be harnessed without relying on advanced frameworks or libraries.

This project serves as a practice exercise to enhance my skills in front-end development. Explore the site to see how intricate designs and engaging user experiences can be created with just HTML and CSS.
